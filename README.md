churchinfo
==========

This is a fork of Churchinfo, a PHP-based church directory program.  There are
some modifications incorporated to clean up the PDF directory format and a very
rudimentary, insecure API.  Don't write API's by this example, unless you're in
a hurry and have no secrets to hide!

This code is uploaded for the benefit of the community, and perhaps someone out
there will take the time to send me a pull request to establish a proper API
for retrieving directory data.

Churchinfo is licensed under various GPL licenses, and this repository ships with
a LICENSE file for GPLv3.
